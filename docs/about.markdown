I worked in the technology industry my whole career (5 years) with roles varying **from marketing to software engineering**. My last employment have me work in **product management** and I lead a team in charge of two end-to-end digital products. My previous employers include ***KompasGramedia*** (one of Indonesia's largest media conglomerates), ***Airy*** (once the leading startup on budget travel) and the technology consulting firm ***Accenture***. I started several businesses and non-profits in parallel. The most notable one being ***BagiKata*** - it's better if you go [there](https://bagikata.com) if you want to know what that is.

I graduated with a **Computer Science undergraduate degree** from ***Universitas Indonesia***, with a thesis mainly talking about how we a computer can generate jazz walking bass lines automatically. I currently am a **Master's degree candidate on Information Technology Strategy** at ***Carnegie Mellon University***, with a concentration on Politics and Strategy. I'm really passionate about the intersections between technology and things that makes humans 'human' (arts, politics, social interactions) and am looking forward for a long career in that field.
