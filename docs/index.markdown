This is the *fourth iteration* of what would be my personal blog. By attaching it to BagiKata's website I hope that I would write more consistently, and would not close the blog entirely if I don't (as I do with my old blogs).

I will write in both Bahasa and English depending on my mood, on wide-ranging topics that I personally have experience and/or knowledge in, as well as things that I find amusing or interesting. That may include technology, life, philosophy, politics, music, design, arts and everything in between. I hope your enjoy your read and I apologize in advance if you find the material to be disturbing, annoying or too opinionated. Happy reading!
