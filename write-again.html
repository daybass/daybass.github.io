I've been so used to the idea that it's going to be only the two of us onward since the moment we got married, that the revelation sucker-punched me.</p><p>Apart from that, the timing was uncanny. First, my wife's flying back in three days as her visitor visa will lapse real soon. Second, the news came just days after I got (and about to accept) two offers, sent out on around the same time: <strong>i)</strong> an offer from a reputable think tank to intern for them the coming Spring; <strong>ii)</strong> a fully funded PhD position in digital mental health in Dublin. The end of my Masters' is coming in two months, and those two offers reflected a solid consequent plan our life could follow after this exciting experience in America - another epic journey. The baby news, at least for me at that point in time, was a brick in the beautiful window that was <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">our</span> my preferred plan.Â </p><p>In truth, this 'thing' happening was kind of natural: me and my wife never actively planned against it, we never actively planned for it either: we would just let it be. And in the States, for the first time in years, we felt freer and happier with each other. We would travel, have lots of fun on the weekends (life savings be damned), and all the Jakarta stress - while it's still there (my wife's still working full-time remotely in a crazy timezone) - seems worlds away. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Exactly the condition to induce baby-making activities.</span></p><p>It just didn't occur to me that it would actually happen. But it did, and we have to act on it, quickly, as my wife's heading back soon and we only have three days of face-to-face discussion. After a lot of tears and fights and long talks, we adjusted the life plan. I would stay in the US to do the internship, plus a second job teaching at the University (I have to recoup our savings we blow on our travels for the kid) while my wife would go back home as planned, continue work, and have her pregnancy around our family and support system back in Jakarta. I'll fly back after the internship is done, which is around two months before the expected delivery date.</p><p>Fast forward six months, I'm back in Jakarta, and after the longest 18-hour of my life, Zeda Ajisaka was born. He changed my life completely.</p><h3>The learning.</h3><p>Fatherhood was <span style="text-decoration: underline;">one of the most challenging experience that ever presents itself to me</span>. Going through a school with an almost unhealthy obsession of military-styled training is draining physically, but you generally don't face real stakes, so mentally, you should be fine. University was a tough one on the brains, but I learned quickly enough that if something drains you, you could just miss tomorrow's class with no real repercussion, so you'll be fine the following day ðŸ˜‰. With work, it might drain you mentally and physically, but you relish in the delight of the paycheck that comes every now and again.</p><p>With babies, it's complicated. You generally can't predict what will happen. No amount of classes I took and books I read prepared me for the reality that is raising kids. And unlike things I've done before: it's tough in all the aspects! You're drained mentally (<em>as you tire your brains out trying to figure out how this black box works and operates</em>), you're drained physically (<em>bye bye sleep - and watch your back - in a literal sense</em>), and you're paying (<strong>a sweet amount</strong>) for this. What you got in return is you got screamed at, (<em>literally</em>) pissed at, (<em>literally</em>) pooped at, and spat at. Umm, for a bit of an upside, maybe in a few occasions they will laugh and they will will look so cute, you'll unsolicited pictures of them to unexpecting (and sometimes unwelcome) audience. <em><strong>And yet you'd die for them.</strong></em>Â </p><p>Why? I honestly don't know - maybe that's why they say blood is thicker than water. The myth of <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">the familial bond</span></strong>. However, I'm not so sure that's all to it.</p><p>I'm still struggling in finding the other parts of the answer, but, one of my favorite things about having a child is you get to learn things about life in a wholly different perspective. I'm writing some of those learnings here so I get to remember (and get to structure it well) and here's hoping maybe you, <em>kind reader</em>, could benefit from the things I think about when I look longingly into my son's eyes.</p><blockquote><p>For all those born beneath an angry star<br>Lest we forget how fragile we are</p><p>- Fragile, Sting (1988)</p></blockquote><p><em><strong>Humans</strong> <strong>are fragile, our bonds makes us strong. </strong></em>The first lesson that my son 'taught' me is that human is inherently fragile. You can't leave babies alone - it can hurt itself just by incorrectly positioning themselves. You have to feed them in a regular rate as they can't feed themselves and if you miss feeding them for some time, they could be fatally sick real quick. They can't clean themselves from the filth they got into, and they can't communicate effectively what they need.</p><p>This turns out to be a uniquely human condition.
